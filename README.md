# Early Data Analysis Projects


This repository contains exploratory and visualization projects completed during my early Data Science learning phase (2019–2021).

These projects helped me build a strong foundation in:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Projects Included
1. **Employee Exit Survey Analysis** – Understanding employee retention patterns  
2. **Gender Gap in STEM Degrees** – Visualizing gender representation in education  
3. **COVID-19 Visualization** – Analyzing global case trends  
4. **Monkeypox Dataset Analysis** – Early-stage epidemiological insights

## Next Steps
- Refactor key analyses into individual repositories  
- Add Power BI or Tableau dashboards
